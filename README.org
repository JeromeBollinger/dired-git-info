* Description

This Emacs packages provides a minor mode which shows git information inside
the dired buffer:

* Installation

** ELPA

This package is available on [[https://elpa.gnu.org][ELPA]]. You can install it via =M-x package-install RET dired-git-info RET=

** Manual

For manual installation, clone the repository and call:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(package-install-file "/path/to/dired-git-info.el")
#+END_SRC

* Config

** Bind the minor mode command in dired

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (define-key dired-mode-map ")" 'dired-git-info-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Don't hide normal Dired file info

By default, toggling =dired-git-info-mode= also toggles the built-in =dired-hide-details-mode=, which hides file details such as ownership, permissions and size. This behaviour can be disabled by overriding =dgi-auto-hide-details-p=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (setq dgi-auto-hide-details-p nil))
#+END_SRC

** Enable automatically in every Dired buffer (if in Git repository)

To enable =dired-git-info-mode= whenever you navigate to a Git repository, add the following snippet:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (defun dired-git-info-mode-loose ()
    "enable 'dired-git-info-mode only if current Dired buffer is in a Git repo"
    (if (locate-dominating-file "." ".git")
        (dired-git-info-mode)))
  (add-hook 'dired-after-readin-hook 'dired-git-info-mode-loose))
#+END_SRC
